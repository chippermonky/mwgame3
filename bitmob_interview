Peter,

Thanks again for taking the time to answer some questions.  If you need any further explanation about the questions, please let me know.  Also if you feel any of the questions would reveal too much about the game’s story or anything else, then please don't answer.  I tried to separate those.  I might have some follow ups after you return your responses, but whenever we’re done I’ll be sure to show you what the final product will look like before I submit it just to make sure you're cool with it.


First a few questions about you and games:

When did your interest in games start?

-Since I picked up an SNES controller at my best friend in elementry school's place. But my interest in games was mostly fueled by deprivation all away up until mid high school when I finally got a good computer and a gamecube. And then I realized I kinda hated games too and that love-hate relationship has been pretty consistent since.

What made you decide you wanted to design games?

-see below.

What are some of your favorite games?

-Latel, I've been playing Dwarf Fortress far more than I should. But Cave Story was what really got me started on the whole indy designer route. 

Assuming you'd like to continue designing, what area of the games industry would you like to be a part of?

-I'd like to avoid the industry if possible. Partly because I disapprove of what the game industry procudes and partly because I find industries to be too counterproductive.

Do you have any other titles lined up?

Yes, I had an idea and then kokomori announced its new theme for gamma4 and they just happen to be compatible so expect something for that. The game is called "Roulette". I'm also making a short series of retro arcade style games with my friend. It's the "tower defense" series. It's a homage and a mashup of old and new conventions.

Cave is very story focused, do you think you would want to work on a game that had little to no story?

The mindset I had going into designing Cave was to design a narrative that capitalizes on the game as a narrative. My big grievance with commercial titles is how the narrative and gameplay are disjoint. The developers come up with a concept "lets make a game about future space soldiers blowing up neo nuclear bipedal cyborg aliens" 

Cave could easily be thrown into the middle of the "games as art" argument.  What is your stance on this, do you believe games can be art?

I'll take this as an opportunity to share a theory of mine. Rather than say yes or talke about how the industry is not mature enough to produce art or talk about how it's the indy developers who are producing art. I'm just going to say no. 

Perhaps one could refer to the long list of definitions that ludologists have come up for a game. (Rules of Play by Salle's and Zimmerman has a lovely table of where these different definitions intersect and differ). By the definition, 

 

Now a few questions about the game:

Is this your first game?

-It's my first complete game, 

Was this a project that you did on your own?

-Yeah, I tried to get my friend to program it but he said he did not want to do a platformer yet so I just went ahead and did it myself. I did all the design and artwork too. For sound, I used SFXR (http://www.drpetter.se/project_sfxr.html) for everything. I tried making some screaming and grunting sounds with a mic but that did not turn out well. It was pretty fun doing the whole thing. I spent about two months on it on and off. Hopefully, my next endeavor will come about much faster now that I have that much more experience.

What came first, the type of game or the story?



What genre would you put Cave into?



The page for Cave on the IGF site has probably the shortest description out of all the titles:  "A boy and a girl exploring a cave."  Even your website just has the logo for the game.  Why did you decide to be so minimalist?



Was the choice to have no music a design choice or a technical one?

-It's both. Designing is all about playing off your weaknesses. Music is an interesting beast. Rarely does it ever "exist" in the space 

You suggest people play the game in fullscreen mode, why is that?

-I had a friend who kept playing cave story in windowed mode with no sound and that was driving me crazy. I eventually formulated the theory that players want agency over their own computer and will play things in windowed mode if they can allowing them to tab out and check their email or walkthroughs or whatever. For aesthic and immersive reasons, games in general do better in fullscreen. For Cave, it was particularly important to me because I felt in fullscreen the game 

Are you concerned about people who don't play your game and assume it's similar to another indie title Cave Story?

Why were there spikes in the game?  You respawn very close to where you die, so what made you decide death was necessary?

Occasionally the characters will, for lack of a better description, pick up a "note," and those "notes" seem to correlate to thoughts they have about each other.  Why did you decide these "notes" should be lying around instead of the characters just speaking at certain check points?

 

These questions go a bit deeper into the game and may be considered a bit too revealing, again, if you feel some things could be kept secret, just let me know:

When the boy dies and you respawn, if you go by the spikes you fell on, all that is left is blood.  When the girl dies her body always remains, and if you die multiples times, multiple bodies are left.  Was there a reason behind that?

There was at least one note that I had to go out of my way to find.  Was there a reason for not putting some notes along the path?

One of the most interesting moments of the game is when, without picking up one of the notes, the text "I want her" appears in front of the boy before a platforming segment.  If you fail during it and respawn the text "harder" appears and then "harder..."  Nothing else similar to that appears in the game.  What was the reasoning behind that?

There are two sections in the game where the boy lights a row of candles.  Is there any significance behind this?

Is there any meaning behind the symbol near the end of the game that looks like an arrow pointing down? 

You've been forward about the game having two endings, do you feel one of them is the true ending?

Ultimately, your avatar is a guy as he makes the only relevent decisions in the game--consequently, the player makes the relevent decision. Neither ending is better or worse for the guy. In one, he 

Do you know anybody who has actually got the good ending first, and not by accident?

For a while, this was a pretty big issue. I made some design changes which would incline players to get the bad ending first. Certainly, some people still get the good ending on their first playthrough, but that's not a hgue deal. If I wanted full control of a player's experience I'd have made "Cave the movie"

Does it bother you that of those who have seen both endings, most people prefer the "bad" ending?



To your knowledge, has everything in the game been discovered?

Finally, what would you like to have players get out of the game?

 

Again thanks for your time, enjoy your day.

-Mike E.
