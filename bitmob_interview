Just one thing about one of your questions:

One of the most interesting moments of the game is when, without picking up one of the notes, the text "I want her" appears in front of the boy before a platforming segment.  If you fail during it and respawn the text "harder" appears and then "harder..."  Nothing else similar to that appears in the game.  What was the reasoning behind that?

There actually is a note that you pick up before it says "I want her" but there is not a note when it says "harder" (that message is triggered upon dying). It's still a good question and I answered it but I don't want the readers to be confused.
