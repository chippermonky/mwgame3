
Peter,

Thanks again for taking the time to answer some questions.  If you need any further explanation about the questions, please let me know.  Also if you feel any of the questions would reveal too much about the game’s story or anything else, then please don't answer.  I tried to separate those.  I might have some follow ups after you return your responses, but whenever we’re done I’ll be sure to show you what the final product will look like before I submit it just to make sure you're cool with it.


First a few questions about you and games:

When did your interest in games start?

-Since I picked up an SNES controller at my best friend in elementry school's place. But my interest in games was mostly fueled by deprivation all away up until mid high school when I finally got a good computer and a gamecube.

What made you decide you wanted to design games?

-My mom got me started on Visual Basic way back and I got to the point where I could make a graphic move around and I had this whole plan to make it shoot bullets at things but never finished it. I love making things whether its food, furniture or games.

What are some of your favorite games?

-Lately, I've been playing Dwarf Fortress far more than I should. But Cave Story was what really got me started on the whole indy designer route. Just to list a few other games I've really enjoyed for one reason or another: La Mulana, Shadow of the Colossus, God Hand, Spelunky.

Assuming you'd like to continue designing, what area of the games industry would you like to be a part of?

-I'd like to avoid the industry if possible. I'm not fond of how any profit/sales oriented industry works. The effect of this really shows in the video game industry.

Do you have any other titles lined up?

Yes, I had an idea and then kokomori announced its new theme for gamma4 and they just happen to be compatible so expect something for that. The game is called "Roulette". I'm also making a short series of retro arcade style games with my friend. The series is called "Tower Defense". It's a homage to the old arcade scene and a mashup of old and new conventions. It's been a very fun project to work on.

Cave is very story focused, do you think you would want to work on a game that had little to no story?

The mindset I had going into designing Cave was to design a narrative that capitalizes on the game medium to create a new unique narrative. My big grievance with commercial titles is how the narrative and gameplay are disjoint. Gameplay opens many new avenues for conveying narrative and meaning and most games do little to explore new avenues. The goal of Cave was to take the illusion of control and construct a story or experience that plays off the idea that the player is in control of the story. There is always a disjoint between the player's character's thoughts and what the player thinks his or her character is thinking and there is no reason these two need to coincide. Cave was exploring narrative possibilities using this idea of disjoint egos. To answer your question, no. I want to experiment in different areas a little more. 

Cave could easily be thrown into the middle of the "games as art" argument.  What is your stance on this, do you believe games can be art?

The big issue with games as art is that games need gameplay. In order for a game to sucessfuly be art, it must bridge the gap between gameplay and its meaning. If it does not, then the gameplay can only detract from the game as art. Lets consider the latest greatest hit, Call Of Duty 5. I have no idea what the game is really about because I have not played it and don't want to. But lets pretend I'm an expert on this game. So I'm playing this game and I'm like fighting some terrorists or something and experiencing the story of a modern soldier and it's fucking real because the graphics are so amazing. I get shot at a few times and my screen starts blinking red so I hide behind a rock where I auto-heal. I power through and kill another 10 terrorist before I accidentally throw a grenade against a wall and kill myself. No big deal right? I start over and this time I'm smart and I don't throw the grenade into a wall and instead I kill another 10 terrorist and keep powering through and save the captive family from the terrorists and I'm moved to tears. New technology has really allowed games to push into the border of realism where there is so much artistic potential. If the "art" behind Call of Duty was to recreate the feeling of being a soldier then it suceeds in recreating the look but fails because it needs to be a game. The narrative constantly cuts to patch up all these artifacts that need to be in place so Call of Duty is still a game. Why does one respawn? So players wont have to replay the game. Why does one heal over time? So players wont die too often. Call of Duty tries to tell the story of a modern soldier and tries to be a fun game at the same time and consequently fails at both.

So perhaps I should give some examples of games that do succeed as art. An early example is an old adventure game which I can not remember the title of anymore. There was a bonus in this game where one could go no a 6 hour roadtrip. The road was pretty straight but the car would slowly drift to the left so one would have to be attentive for the whole 6 hours. This was a game about going on a roadtrip and did a pretty damn good job of recreating it. In all its seriousness, it suceeds as a pretty absurd piece of art and fits most definitions of a game as well.

A very straightforward example of where gameplay and meaning are intertwined is Cactus's Life is a Race. The game is totally self explanatory and takes about 10 seconds to play so anyone reading this should stop and play the game right now. The gameplay directly transcribes itself to the meaning of the game.



There is also much potential for games as art when put in installation (which might be a focus for myself in the future). Consider the works of artists like Eddo Stern's Tekken Torture Tournament, Waco Resserection and cockfight or Stephen Lavelle's "Happenning Game". I see no distinction between these and any other interactive art piece. When we argue of games being art, both parties tend to neglect games as installations which is arguably a digression (in the same sense we do not consider video art when we argue whether movies are art or not) but I feel I should mention this because most people are not aware such games even exist.
 

Now a few questions about the game:

Is this your first game?

-It's my first game that I can call complete. 

Was this a project that you did on your own?

-Yeah, I tried to get my friend to program it but he said he did not want to do a platformer yet so I just went ahead and did it myself. I did all the design and artwork too. For sound, I used SFXR (http://www.drpetter.se/project_sfxr.html) for everything. I tried making some screaming and grunting sounds with a mic but that did not turn out well. It was pretty fun doing the whole thing. I spent about two months on it on and off. Hopefully, my next endeavor will come about much faster now that I have that much more experience.

What came first, the type of game or the story?

-The type of narrative came first. Then I designed the settings and the characters and eventually the story in that order.

What genre would you put Cave into?

A platformer? Not really ha ha. I do not know. The thought never ocurred to me. The current convention for typing video games by genres only clasify a very unspecific set of core mechanics. If I had to though, I would say adventure.

The page for Cave on the IGF site has probably the shortest description out of all the titles:  "A boy and a girl exploring a cave."  Even your website just has the logo for the game.  Why did you decide to be so minimalist?

I was a bit conflicted about this decision. It always bothers me a little bit when the author of a game puts the game out complete with its own Cliff Notes. I feel the only time when something should be explained is when it inloves some reference that players can not be reasonably expected to know (for example, some cultural practice, or some personal experience). The game should really speak for itself. Of course, its always a battle between the audience and the author. Especially for someone who has no credibility, there is little incentive for players delve deeper. 

Was the choice to have no music a design choice or a technical one?

-It's both. Designing is all about playing off your weaknesses. Music is an interesting beast. Rarely does it ever "exist" in the space 

You suggest people play the game in fullscreen mode, why is that?

-I had a friend who kept playing cave story in windowed mode with no sound and that was driving me crazy. I eventually formulated the theory that players want agency over their own computer and will play things in windowed mode if they can allowing them to tab out and check their email or walkthroughs or whatever. For aesthic and immersive reasons, games in general do better in fullscreen. For Cave, it was particularly important to me because I felt in fullscreen the game 

Are you concerned about people who don't play your game and assume it's similar to another indie title Cave Story?

Why were there spikes in the game?  You respawn very close to where you die, so what made you decide death was necessary?

Occasionally the characters will, for lack of a better description, pick up a "note," and those "notes" seem to correlate to thoughts they have about each other.  Why did you decide these "notes" should be lying around instead of the characters just speaking at certain check points?

 

These questions go a bit deeper into the game and may be considered a bit too revealing, again, if you feel some things could be kept secret, just let me know:

When the boy dies and you respawn, if you go by the spikes you fell on, all that is left is blood.  When the girl dies her body always remains, and if you die multiples times, multiple bodies are left.  Was there a reason behind that?

There was at least one note that I had to go out of my way to find.  Was there a reason for not putting some notes along the path?

One of the most interesting moments of the game is when, without picking up one of the notes, the text "I want her" appears in front of the boy before a platforming segment.  If you fail during it and respawn the text "harder" appears and then "harder..."  Nothing else similar to that appears in the game.  What was the reasoning behind that?

There are two sections in the game where the boy lights a row of candles.  Is there any significance behind this?

Is there any meaning behind the symbol near the end of the game that looks like an arrow pointing down? 

You've been forward about the game having two endings, do you feel one of them is the true ending?

Ultimately, your avatar is a guy as he makes the only relevent decisions in the game--consequently, the player makes the relevent decision. Neither ending is better or worse for the guy. In one, he 

Do you know anybody who has actually got the good ending first, and not by accident?

For a while, this was a pretty big issue. I made some design changes which would incline players to get the bad ending first. Certainly, some people still get the good ending on their first playthrough, but that's not a hgue deal. If I wanted full control of a player's experience I'd have made "Cave the movie"

Does it bother you that of those who have seen both endings, most people prefer the "bad" ending?



To your knowledge, has everything in the game been discovered?

Finally, what would you like to have players get out of the game?

 

Again thanks for your time, enjoy your day.
