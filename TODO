URGENT! make animation wheel to speed up loading

add more than one wall tile type

sounds. Made good progress, satisfactory

redo man animation walk and jump, maybe... May not need this anymore

ropes and falling to death, allow jumping off ropes and dropping new ropes?? Limited number of ropes means may have to start over if you run out of ropes???

man flashlight should be directional (optional)

Redo movement. Have frames define acceleration NOT velocity. Make man 
move faster and more smoothly. Maybe I don't want to do this anymore... 
movements is okay enough for now

[DONE] [WITH EFFECT] torch lighting, play a little spark animation, limited fuel? 
currently added SOUNd, maybe should add EFFECT

[DONE for now] redo movement, guy should move fast and easy, girl should 
move realistically

[DONE] redo girl crawling animation

[DONE] redo eye color for all girl

[DONE] added two levels to wall lighting, consider doing more???


[DONE] refractor code so that lights work properly. Edit draw function to take flags (do draw routine/update routine only)

[basic scripting DONE] test out scripting for door, do inital few floors

[SOLVED, may need to write grid enlarge/shrink script] figure out how the whole area mojo is going to work. Draw a big rect around the whole matrix and see if it is enough space. Make sketch in editor of what level will look like.
