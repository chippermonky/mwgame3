out of ropes??? [OPTIONAL but you should really consider it]

[OUT]man flashlight should be directional [OPTIONAL]

[OUT]Redo movement. Have frames define acceleration NOT velocity. Make 
man 
move faster and more smoothly. Maybe I don't want to do this anymore... 
movements is okay enough for now [OPTIONAL]

[basic scripting DONE] test out scripting for door, do inital few floors

[SOLVED, may need to write grid enlarge/shrink script] figure out how the whole area mojo is going to work. Draw a big rect around the whole matrix and see if it is enough space. Make sketch in editor of what level will look like.

[DONE] add two torches at the intersection where they split, add double 
button 
before the initial drop so both players are required to be nearbye (teamwork), add respawn points after initial split so people dont respawn in the splitting area and get stuck.
